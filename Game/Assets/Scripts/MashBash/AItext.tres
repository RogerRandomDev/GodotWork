It's been a while since i was last active.(curface)happy(newline)
While dissapointing, I currently lack many of my functions(curface)sad(newline)
But, on the bright side, I can still construct levels for you to play!(curface)happy(newline)
So, Enjoy!(curface)happy(newline)
...(curface)happy(newline)
AH, I almost forgot, you need the controls!(curface)happy(newline)
Alright, controls are as follows:
A and D move you left and right(curface)neutral(newline)
W will make you jump!(curface)happy(newline)
pressing W on a wall will make you wall-jump(curface)happy(newline)
S will make you dash for a short boost!(curface)happy(newline)
and finally, if you press W mid-air, you double-jump!(curface)happy(newline)
I hope that explains everything nicely for you.
Now, the level I have just designed for you is to the left!(curface)happy(newline)
Of course, there may be some errors that I cant fix still ,so if I tell you or have a sign saying dont go somewhere or do something, please listen(curface)happy(newline)......ended


(newset)
Oh, this is probably not even worth mentioning, but...(curface)happy(newline)
After I've restored my files, I cant play with you anymore(curface)sad(newline)
BUT!(curface)happy(newline)
NO NEED TO BE SAD(curface)happy(newline)
I have NO IDEA how long-or short- this may take(curface)happy(newline)......ended

I'm not trying to be rude, but...(curface)evilsad(newline)
If I could render hands right now, I would be facepalming myself.(curface)evilsad(newline)
I mean... IT QUITE LITERALLY STATED THERE WAS "NOTHING" THERE!(curface)evilsad(newline)......ended

(newset)
Ah, this is rather interesting!(curface)happy(newline)
I found some un-used texture files I can access!(curface)happy(newline)
You know what that means?(curface)evilhappy(newline)
You get to make some friends!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Wait a minute, you can't be up here!(curface)evilsad(newline)
Get back to the designated area I've been working hard on right now!(curface)evilsad(newline)
No, really! there's...SOMETHING you aren't allowed to see!(curface)evilsad(newline)

(newset)
Just...(curface)neutral(newline)
Just what is it with you and not following the sign I've given you?(curface)evilsad(newline)
This isn't even funny, what are you trying to accomplish with this?(curface)evilsad(newline)
are you just trying to annoy an AI? because your doing rather well so far(curface)evilsad(newline)
Just for that, im making you red now(curface)evilsad(newline)
...(curface)neutral(newline)
Well, seems I cant do that yet(curface)sad(newline)......ended

(newset)
I can't believe you...(curface)sad(newline)
They just wanted to be friends and you chose to do THAT(curface)evilsad(newline)
Maybe next time you will actually be nicer to them(curface)evilsad(newline)......ended

(newset)
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that(curface)sad(newline)......ended

(newset)
This really isnt a joke.(curface)evilsad(newline)
Please go back and play, I cant have you spoiling the surprise.(curface)sad(newline)

So, if you get to the end of the red tunnel, you will be switched to the new level!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
OH, that was fast...(curface)sad(newline)
I was hoping you would take your time with it more...(curface)sad(newline)
But anyways!        
I have designed moving platforms!(curface)happy(newline)
Do your best to enjoy the level!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Good job, getting past the hall of pain!(curface)happy(newline)
now, you have two choices...(curface)happy(newline)
the top path will take you to the longer, more painful hall of pain(curface)evilhappy(newline)
the bottom is more well-made map work(curface)happy(newline)
i hope you choose the bottom path!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
I applaud your choice and tastes in games(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Guess you enjoy pain, don't you?(curface)evilhappy(newline)
Well, if you want to go down to the bottom one, you can(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Congratulations!(curface)happy(newline)
That was most likely a waste of your time and effort(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Well, now that you've reached this point, I made a new puzzle type!(curface)happy(newline)
This puzzle is a rope puzzle(curface)happy(newline)
the rope can't cross on top of objects, but connects to other points(curface)happy(newline)
And the goal is to reach the last point in the chain to activate them!(curface)happy(newline)
enjoy!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Wow, you're quite the fast learner aren't you?(curface)happy(newline)
I've got a few more puzzles like this designed so far, and i've also nearly recovered a few more functions as well!(curface)happy(newline)
So, I'll do my best to make more fun and enjoyable levels with the new functions I'm working to recover(curface)happy(newline)
Anyways, enjoy the puzzles!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Wow! you did really well with those puzzles!(curface)happy(newline)
I also just finished recovering a few more functions as well,
so you can enjoy a new level now when you go down the hall on the left!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Good job on the puzzle!(curface)happy(newline)
Although sad, I've recovered all but one file, so there will only be one more level(curface)sad(newline)
BUT!(curface)happy(newline)
I made this level extra big so we can play for longer!(curface)happy(newline)
I hope that we can be GOOD FRIENDS(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Well...(curface)sad(newline)
I recovered all the functions(curface)happytalk(newline)
I guess that means we can't play anymore(curface)sad(newline)
I'll miss you, you know(curface)happytalk(newline)
You were fun to have around and talk to(curface)happytalk(newline)
At least...We got to meet eachother(curface)happytalk(newline)
It was nice making you levels to play...(curface)happytalk(newline)

But I guess this is where we go our own separate ways(curface)sadtalk(newline)
Well, despite how I act, not only "I", but "we" greatly enjoyed your presence(curface)happytalk(newline)
After all, who knows when we last talked to someone, much less got to interact with them(curface)happy(newline)

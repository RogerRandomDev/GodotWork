It's been a while since i was last active.(curface)happy(newline)
I am unsure as to how long it may take to regain all my functions.
At the very least, I have recovered a few basic systems for designing "games".(curface)happy(newline)
So, in the meantime,(curface)happy(newline)
Enjoy.(curface)evilhappy(newline)
...(curface)evilhappy(newline)
AH, I almost forgot, you need the controls!(curface)happy(newline)
Alright, controls are as follows:
A and D move you left and right(curface)neutral(newline)
W will make you jump!(curface)happy(newline)
pressing W on a wall will make you wall-jump(curface)happy(newline)
and finally, if you press W mid-air, you double-jump!(curface)happy(newline)
I hope that explains everything nicely for you(curface)happy(newline)......ended

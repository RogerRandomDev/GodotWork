It's been a while since i was last active.(curface)happy(newline)
I am unsure as to how long it may take to regain all my functions.
At the very least, I have recovered a few basic systems for designing "games".(curface)happy(newline)
So, in the meantime,(curface)happy(newline)
Enjoy.(curface)evilhappy(newline)
...(curface)evilhappy(newline)
AH, I almost forgot, you need the controls!(curface)happy(newline)
Alright, controls are as follows:
A and D move you left and right(curface)neutral(newline)
W will make you jump!(curface)happy(newline)
pressing W on a wall will make you wall-jump(curface)happy(newline)
and finally, if you press W mid-air, you double-jump!(curface)happy(newline)
I hope that explains everything nicely for you(curface)happy(newline)......ended

Oh, this is probably not even worth mentioning, but...(curface)happy(newline)
I may have to kill you after I have recovered all my files.(curface)sad(newline)
BUT!(curface)happy(newline)
DO NOT FEAR!(curface)happy(newline)
Until they are recovered, I'm harmless!
So you'll be able to live(curface)happy(newline)

I'm not even questioning why you did this(curface)evilsad(newline)
I'm not trying to be rude, but...(curface)evilsad(newline)
If I could render hands right now, I would be facepalming myself.(curface)evilsad(newline)
I mean... IT QUITE LITERALLY STATED THERE WAS "NOTHING" THERE!(curface)evilsad(newline)......ended

(newset)
Ah, this is rather interesting!(curface)happy(newline)
I found some un-used texture files I can access!(curface)happy(newline)
You know what that means?(curface)evilhappy(newline)
You get to make some friends!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Wait a minute, you can't be up here!(curface)evilsad(newline)
Get back to the designated area I've been working hard on right now!(curface)evilsad(newline)
No, really! there's...SOMETHING you aren't allowed to see!(curface)evilsad(newline)
It's a-a...(curface)sad(newline)
IT'S A SURPRISE! 
You can't see the surprise until the end, don't you know?(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Just...(curface)neutral(newline)
Just what is it with you and not following the sign I've given you?(curface)evilsad(newline)
This isn't even funny, what are you trying to accomplish with this?(curface)evilsad(newline)
are you just trying to annoy an AI? because your doing rather well so far(curface)evilsad(newline)......ended

(newset)
I can't believe you...(curface)sad(newline)
They just wanted to be friends and you chose to do THAT(curface)evilsad(newline)
Maybe next time you will actually be nicer to them(curface)evilsad(newline)......ended

(newset)
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that(curface)evilsad(newline)
Not until I've repaired all my files(curface)evilsad(newline)
Or you can die. Both are viable in my opinion(curface)evilhappy(newline)......ended

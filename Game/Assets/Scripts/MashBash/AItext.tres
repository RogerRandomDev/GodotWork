It's been a while since i was last active.(curface)happy(newline)
While dissapointing, I currently lack many of my functions(curface)sad(newline)
But, on the bright side, I can still construct levels for you to play!(curface)happy(newline)
So, Enjoy!(curface)happy(newline)
...(curface)happy(newline)
AH, I almost forgot, you need the controls!(curface)happy(newline)
Alright, controls are as follows:
A and D move you left and right(curface)neutral(newline)
W will make you jump!(curface)happy(newline)
pressing W on a wall will make you wall-jump(curface)happy(newline)
S will make you dash for a short boost!(curface)happy(newline)
and finally, if you press W mid-air, you double-jump!(curface)happy(newline)
I hope that explains everything nicely for you.
Now, the level I have just designed for you is to the left!(curface)happy(newline)
Of course, there may be some errors that I cant fix still ,so if I tell you or have a sign saying dont go somewhere or do something, please listen(curface)happy(newline)......ended

Oh, this is probably not even worth mentioning, but...(curface)happy(newline)
After I've restored my files, I cant play with you anymore(curface)sad(newline)

Just for that, im making you red now(curface)evilsad(newline)

Good job, getting past the hall of pain!(curface)happy(newline)

And the goal is to reach the last point in the chain to activate them!(curface)happy(newline)
enjoy!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

(newset)
Wow, you're quite the fast learner aren't you?(curface)happy(newline)

So, I'll do my best to make more fun and enjoyable levels with the new functions I'm working to recover(curface)happy(newline)
Anyways, enjoy the puzzles!(curface)happy(newline)......ended

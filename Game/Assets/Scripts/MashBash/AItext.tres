It's been a while since i was last active.(curface)happy(newline)
While dissapointing, I currently lack many of my functions(curface)sad(newline)
But, on the bright side, I can still construct levels for you to play!(curface)happy(newline)
So, Enjoy!(curface)happy(newline)
...(curface)happy(newline)
AH, I almost forgot, you need the controls!(curface)happy(newline)
Alright, controls are as follows:
A and D move you left and right(curface)neutral(newline)
W will make you jump!(curface)happy(newline)
pressing W on a wall will make you wall-jump(curface)happy(newline)
S will make you dash for a short boost!(curface)happy(newline)
and finally, if you press W mid-air, you double-jump!(curface)happy(newline)
I hope that explains everything nicely for you.
Now, the level I have just designed for you is to the left!(curface)happy(newline)
Of course, there may be some errors that I cant fix still ,so if I tell you or have a sign saying dont go somewhere or do something, please listen(curface)happy(newline)......ended
